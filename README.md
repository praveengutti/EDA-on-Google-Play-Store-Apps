# EDA-on-Google-Play-Store-Apps
Over the years, Google Play Store has evolved into a one-stop platform for downloading apps from different categories. It is the central hub for millions of apps for your smartphone. In this project, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Play Store App by comparing over ten thousand apps and reviews across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.
